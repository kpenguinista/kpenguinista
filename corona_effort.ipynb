    "During the past 4 months of quarantine, our news feeds have been flooded with daily media coverage of the coronavirus pandemic and its statistics. As we progress through the summer months, there has been an increasing interest in what the road to recovery looks like in the months ahead and in the measures that have been adopted thus far. We hear of new policies being implemented everyday during these \"unprecedented times,\" as many have phrased to describe the crisis. In some countries, there has been significant reductions in cases due to well-adopted measurements. On the other hand, as the cases in the US continues to rise, the nation is on track as the epicenter of the pandemic, and there is an abundance of news outlets discussing the relatively minimal efforts and slow progress made by the US government. \n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "Since there are plenty of public data sets for the pandemic, I wanted to create a self-defined measure of <b> effort </b> because the available data sets mostly concern the effects of the coronavirus compared to the efforts. For instance, the Bureau of Labor Statistics measured effects using the current population <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/covid19/measuring-the-effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-using-the-current-population-survey.htm\">survey</a>. I will utilize this self-defined measurement to visualize and thereby gain insight into the relative efforts made by countries through quantitative lens. Also, I hope to inform the public of the United States' efforts in comparison to the world.   "

    "First, I started by searching the Internet for official data sets. I will be using a <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data\">data set</a> from a scientific online publication called Our World in Data (OWID). The OWID data consists of a variety of coronavirus statistics, and the ACAPS <a href=\"https://www.acaps.org/covid19-government-measures-dataset\">data set</a> holds a combination of qualitative and quantitative information on governmental measures, of which I am interested in the initial policy implementation dates. For both data sets, extracting the data and converting them into data frames was fairly easy because of they were stored in well-structured csv and excel form, respectively."
